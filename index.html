          Secure EHR 2.0 is a blockchain-powered application designed to help
          medical professionals securely store and share patients' electronic
          health records. With enhanced security and privacy features, this
          system offers a decentralized approach to health data management.

        <h2 class="section-title">Overview of the System</h2>
        <p>
          The primary goal of Secure EHR 2.0 is to create a secure and
          decentralized platform for storing and sharing electronic health
          records. The system supports different user roles, such as patients,
          doctors, and administrators, each with varying levels of access and
          responsibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The system is built on blockchain technology to ensure data integrity
          and security, with transactions handled via a Proof of Work (PoW)
          consensus mechanism and encrypted using SHA-256 hashing. By leveraging
          IPFS for storage and Ethereum for smart contracts, Secure EHR 2.0
          provides a tamper-proof solution for managing health records.

      <div id="workflow" class="content-section dark-section">
        <h2 class="section-title">How It Works</h2>
        <p>
          The workflow of Secure EHR 2.0 involves multiple user roles—Admin,
          Doctor, and Patient—each interacting with the system via Metamask and
          the blockchain network. Below is a step-by-step explanation of the
          entire process.
        </p>

        <!-- Step 3.1 -->
        <div class="workflow-step mt-5">
          <h4 class="mb-3">Admin Login and Access</h4>
          <p>
            The Admin logs into the system using Metamask, which serves as the
            authentication mechanism. The admin dashboard is accessible only
            through a valid Metamask account.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon successful login, the Admin can access a comprehensive
            dashboard displaying all hospital-related details, including
            statistics, registered users, and overall system health.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Step 3.2 -->
        <div class="workflow-step mt-5">
          <h4 class="mb-3">Adding a Doctor</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Introduction to Ganache:</strong> The system uses Ganache, a
            local blockchain environment, to simulate transactions and manage
            user profiles. Ganache provides a set of test accounts with public
            and private keys, which are used to manage different user roles in
            the system.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Admin initiates the process of adding a doctor by selecting a
            public key from one of the Ganache profiles. This key uniquely
            identifies the doctor within the system.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Admin then enters the doctor’s details, such as name,
            specialization, and contact information, and submits the
            transaction. Metamask prompts the Admin to confirm the transaction,
            which is then processed on the blockchain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once confirmed, the doctor is successfully added to the hospital’s
            database, with their profile securely stored on the blockchain.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Step 3.3 -->
        <div class="workflow-step mt-5">
          <h4 class="mb-3">Doctor Login and Profile Setup</h4>
          <p>
            The newly added Doctor can log into the system using the private key
            associated with their Ganache profile. This key is used to
            authenticate their identity through Metamask.
          </p>
          <p>
            After logging in, the Doctor gains access to their profile, where
            they can manage patient appointments, view consultation history, and
            update medical records.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Step 3.4 -->
        <div class="workflow-step mt-5">
          <h4 class="mb-3">Patient Registration and Appointment Booking</h4>
          <p>
            Similar to the doctor, the Patient logs in using a private key from
            another Ganache profile through Metamask.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon logging in, the Patient can register their profile by providing
            personal details such as name, age, medical history, and contact
            information.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Patient can then browse the list of available doctors and book
            an appointment based on their medical needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The appointment request is recorded on the blockchain and becomes
            visible in the selected doctor’s dashboard.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Step 3.5 -->
        <div class="workflow-step mt-5">
          <h4 class="mb-3">Doctor Consultation and Prescription</h4>
          <p>
            The Doctor views the appointment request on their dashboard and
            accepts the consultation.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the consultation, the Doctor records the necessary medical
            notes and prescriptions. These records are encrypted using RSA
            encryption before being uploaded to IPFS.
          </p>
          <p>
            The IPFS generates a unique hash for the encrypted file, which is
            stored on the blockchain. This ensures that the medical record is
            secure, immutable, and only accessible through the blockchain.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Step 3.6 -->
        <div class="workflow-step mt-5">
          <h4 class="mb-3">Patient Access to Health Records</h4>
          <p>
            After the consultation, the Patient can log back into the system
            using Metamask and retrieve their health records.
          </p>
          <p>
            To view their health record, the Patient requests the encrypted
            file’s hash from the blockchain. The system then retrieves the file
            from IPFS using this hash.
          </p>
          <p>
            The file is decrypted using the Patient’s private key, allowing them
            to view their health record. Neither the doctor nor the admin has
            access to this decrypted information, ensuring complete privacy.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Step 3.7 -->
        <div class="workflow-step mt-5">
          <h4 class="mb-3">Enhanced Security Measures</h4>
          <p>
            To further secure the system, the hash key used to retrieve the
            health record from the blockchain undergoes additional cryptographic
            transformations. This adds another layer of security, preventing
            unauthorized access to the data.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

        <h2 class="section-title">System Implementation</h2>
        <p>
          The system divides users into two primary categories: administrators
          and regular users (doctors and patients). Administrators assign roles
          and access levels, allowing doctors to manage appointments and patient
          records while ensuring patients have control over who can view their
          data.
